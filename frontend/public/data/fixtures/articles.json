    "abstract": "Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication following cardiac surgery with significant morbidity and mortality. This multicenter prospective cohort study aims to evaluate risk factors and outcomes associated with postoperative AKI. Methods: Adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery were enrolled across 12 medical centers. Primary outcome was development of AKI defined by KDIGO criteria within 7 days post-surgery. Results: Among 1,850 patients, 32% developed AKI. Independent risk factors included advanced age, diabetes, preoperative renal dysfunction, and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time. Patients with AKI had longer hospital stays and higher 30-day mortality. Conclusions: AKI remains a significant complication following cardiac surgery with multiple modifiable risk factors identified.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To compare the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors versus ARBs in slowing chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression using real-world data. Design: Retrospective cohort study using electronic health records from a large healthcare system. Participants: 15,420 adults with stage 3-4 CKD followed for median 4.2 years. Interventions: Treatment with ACE inhibitors (n=8,305) or ARBs (n=7,115). Main Outcomes: Primary endpoint was composite of 40% decline in eGFR, end-stage renal disease, or death. Results: No significant difference in primary endpoint between ACE inhibitors and ARBs (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96-1.15). Both drug classes showed similar cardiovascular protection and adverse event profiles. Conclusions: In real-world practice, ACE inhibitors and ARBs demonstrate comparable effectiveness for CKD progression.",

    "abstract": "Background: The optimal timing for initiating renal replacement therapy (RRT) in acute kidney injury (AKI) remains controversial. This randomized controlled trial compared early versus standard RRT initiation strategies. Methods: Critically ill patients with severe AKI were randomized to early RRT (within 12 hours of meeting criteria) or standard RRT (clinical indication-based). Primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included dialysis independence, hospital length of stay, and complications. Results: 620 patients were randomized (310 per group). No significant difference in 90-day mortality (early 41% vs standard 43%, p=0.65). Early strategy resulted in more RRT sessions and catheter-related complications without improved survival or renal recovery. Conclusions: Early RRT initiation did not improve outcomes compared to standard strategy in critically ill AKI patients.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. We developed a machine learning model to predict DN progression using routinely collected clinical data. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 25,890 patients with type 2 diabetes and early-stage nephropathy. Gradient boosting algorithms were trained on 80% of data using demographics, laboratory values, medications, and comorbidities. Primary outcome was progression to advanced CKD (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73m²) or ESRD within 5 years. Results: The model achieved AUROC 0.84 (95% CI 0.82-0.86) in validation cohort. Top predictors included baseline eGFR, HbA1c, albuminuria, systolic blood pressure, and duration of diabetes. Model outperformed traditional risk scores (KDIGO: AUROC 0.76). Conclusions: Machine learning models using EHR data can accurately predict diabetic nephropathy progression, enabling earlier intervention strategies.",

This pragmatic trial evaluated dapagliflozin in non-diabetic CKD patients. Methods: Multi-site randomized trial enrolling 2,152 adults with CKD stages 2-4 without diabetes. Participants received dapagliflozin 10mg daily or placebo. Primary endpoint was composite of sustained eGFR decline ≥50%, ESRD, or renal death. Median follow-up 2.8 years. Results: Primary endpoint occurred in 197 (18.3%) dapagliflozin vs 312 (29.0%) placebo patients (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.47-0.67, p<0.001). Benefits consistent across CKD stages and etiologies. Adverse events similar between groups except higher genital infections with dapagliflozin. Conclusions: Dapagliflozin significantly reduced CKD progression risk in non-diabetic patients, supporting broader use of SGLT2 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Background: Long-term outcomes data for living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) are essential for informed decision-making. We evaluated 15-year outcomes in a large LDKT cohort. Methods: Prospective observational study of 3,450 LDKT recipients transplanted between 2005-2010. Outcomes included graft survival, patient survival, rejection episodes, and quality of life. Comparison group included 2,890 deceased donor transplant recipients. Results: 15-year graft survival was 68% for LDKT vs 52% for deceased donor (p<0.001). Patient survival was 82% vs 71% (p<0.001). LDKT recipients had lower acute rejection rates (18% vs 29%, p<0.001) and better renal function throughout follow-up. Quality of life scores were consistently higher in LDKT group. Donor outcomes showed excellent long-term safety with <2% developing ESRD. Conclusions: LDKT demonstrates superior long-term outcomes compared to deceased donor transplantation with excellent donor safety profile.",
