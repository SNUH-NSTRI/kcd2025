      "full_text": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696 with enalapril on morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF.\n\nMETHODS: In this randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 8442 patients with NYHA class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive either LCZ696 (200 mg twice daily) or enalapril (10 mg twice daily).\n\nRESULTS: The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or a first hospitalization for heart failure. LCZ696 was superior to enalapril in reducing the risks of death and of hospitalization for heart failure.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: LCZ696 was more effective than enalapril in reducing the risks of death and of hospitalization for heart failure.",
